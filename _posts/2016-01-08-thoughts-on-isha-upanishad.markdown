## Verse 1

**ईशा  वास्यमिदं सर्वं यत् किञ्च जगत्यां जगत्।**  
**तेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद् धनम्॥**  

Consciousness resides in anything that moves in this universe.
Hence derive enjoyment out of sacrifice, and never desire for someone else's wealth.

### Background

Consciousness (purush/brahma etc) pervades the universe and has existed from the creation. It is a **"truth"**. It does have a beginning or an end.

**Prakriti** by definition is the the 'substance' which was present at the point of origin of the universe. In modern terms it is the matter from which the big bang started.
We will refer to matter which is derived from prakriti to be prakriti itself.

Modern science deals ONLY with **prakriti**. 

We are yet to comprehend consciousness.

### Notes on इशा वास्यमिदं सर्वं

Consciousness covers us like a cloth around us. It is present everywhere and the ultimate truth.

##### What is Truth

Truth is something which does not change with space, or time, or envioronment.
For example, there is **truth** in the following statement:

- **Anything which has a beginning has an end**  

or  

- **Something which does not have a beginning does not have an end**

The following statement is **NOT** true:

- _Relative velocity is v1 + v2._. This statement is not true as we have now come to know
about relativistic corrections and will not hold when v1 and v2 are comparable to the speed of light.


### Notes on जगत्यां जगत्

Consciousness is present in anything that moves.

As per Newtonian law, object can only change velocity when acted upon by some force.
The types of forces known till date are:

- Gravitational
- Electromagnetic
- Strong Nuclear
- Weak Nuclear

The **nuclear** forces operate at sub-atomic distances.

#### Gravitational Force

For a long time the cause of gravitation was believed to be due to the exchange of 
particles called gravitons. Albert Einstein said that mass can cause space to warp
and this warping causes another body close to it to start moving towards it with an
acceleration, resulting in what we call the **'graviational force'**.
However, why mass causes warping of space is yet to be answered.

#### Electromagnetic Force
